    "about": "About me",
    "p1": "Hello! My name is Julie and I’m a professional graphic designer and illustrator with over nine years of experience. I attended the Savannah College of Art and Design and obtained a B.F.A. in Sequential Art (storyboarding, illustration/inking for comics and character design) and began as a freelance inker and colorist for a few independent titles before finding my passion in graphic design.",
    "p2": "It all began when I noticed that the University of Alabama (specifically the sports department) held a contest for a comic book illustrator to work on their first title - “Champions” published by Crimson Tide Productions.  I submitted and won which became an incredibly fortuatous and life changing experience. I eventually became an intern at Crimson Tide Productions and worked on various logos and graphics for each sports department.  I met and worked with a lot of talented and dedicated people that truly impacted and inspired the designer that I am today.",
    "p3": "From there I’ve branched out to really understand the printing process and how various digital machines handle and interpret color profiles. This experience instilled confidence in my knowledge of color theory and gave me a profound appreciation about the importance of creating and saving files correctly. These choices affect the flow of production.",
    "p4": "I’m originally from Pennsylvania but I consider Alabama to be my home now.  I enjoy spending time with my 50 lb lap dog, Athena, and watching movies in my free time.",
    "p5": "I can be reached at <strong>jelantrip@gmail.com</strong> for inquiries."
